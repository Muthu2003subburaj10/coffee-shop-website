      <pre class="pretag">What is an Americano?
            The americano is often mistaken 
            for just a standard black coffee,
            but it's so much more than that.</pre>

      <pre class="pretag">What is a Cortado?
        The cortado is relatively new in the world 
        of coffee and many get it confused with a
         flat white. So, what is a cortado and 
         what makes it different?</pre>

        <pre class="pretag">What is a Macchiato?
            An espresso coffee drink, topped with
            a small amount of foamed milk to enable
            the espresso taste to shine through.</pre>
        <a href="#"><img class="cafe_6" src="cafe7.webp"></a>
        <pre class="pretag">What is an Irish Coffee?
            Irish coffee has four main ingredients: 
            coffee, Irish whiskey, sugar and cream.
            But there are many variations of this 
            classic coffee drink, which we willl 
            explore later.</pre>
        <a href="#"><img class="cafe_6" src="cafe9.webp"></a>
        <pre class="pretag">What is a Café au Lait?
            The Café au Lait is made using brewed 
            coffee and steamed milk, in a typical
            ratio of one part coffee to one part 
            steamed milk with no froth or foam on 
            top (sometimes certain coffee shops will add it though).
            The coffee base is usually made with a French press or 
            a drip and the milk must always be steamed.
        </pre>
        <a href="#"><img class="cafe_6" src="cafe12.webp"></a>
        <pre class="pretag">What is Instant Coffee?
            nstant coffee is made from real coffee beans. 
            The soluble and volatile contents of the beans
            are extracted. Then the water is removed so powder
            or concentrated soluble coffee powder are left over.
            It’s essentially been dehydrated for our convenience.
        </pre>
        <a href="#"><img class="cafe_6" src="cafe10.webp"></a>
        <pre class="pretag">What is Cold Brew?
            Cold brew coffee is made by slowly steeping 
            coarsely ground coffee beans in room temperature
            water for at least six hours (it can be as much
            as up to 24, but it depends on how strong you 
            want your cold brew it to be, many choose to do it overnight).
        </pre>
        <a href="#"><img class="cafe_6" src="cafe5.webp"></a>
        <pre class="pretag">What is a Flat White?
            A flat white is a blend of micro-foamed milk poured
        over a single or double shot of espresso. This microfoam is steamed 
    milk infused with air, to create a smooth and velvety texture and creamy taste. 
    Precise pouring and steaming of the microfoamis essential in making a flat white.

        <a href="#"><img class="cafe_6" src="cafe8.webp"></a>
        <pre class="pretag">What is an Iced Coffee?
            If you’re asking yourself ‘what is an iced coffee?’,
        then look no further. Quite simply, an iced coffee is a cold 
    version of your favourite coffee, but it’s not simply a coffee that
     has been left to cool.
        </pre>
        <a href="#"><img class="cafe_6" src="cafe11.webp"></a>
        <pre class="pretag">What is Drip Coffee?
            Drip coffee is made by pouring boiling water
            over ground coffee (the grind of which being
            much coarser than espresso). A filter that 
            is typically made from paper separates the 
            grounds from the brewed liquid which allows
            the water to pass through and fall into a pot or jug. 
        </pre>
        <a href="#"><img class="cafe_6" src="cafe6.webp"></a>
        <pre class="pretag">What is a Decaf?
            Decaf coffee is made from regular coffee 
        beans that go through a process to remove the majority
     of the caffeine. However, decaffeinated coffee is not completely 
caffeine free, and EU regulation for decaf coffee is less than 0.3% caffeine.

<pre class="pretag2">How many coffee types exist?

            together some of our favourite coffee types for you to try at home - easy recipe
         with muthuCAFE instant coffee as the starting point. From the well-known cappuccino, espresso, 
     and latte, to the lungo, ristretto, café au lait and cold brew, there are so many types of coffee to enjoy.

<pre class="pretag2">Which coffee type has the strongest taste?

    The strongest type of coffee is freshly brewed espresso. It forms the base for most coffee drinks, 
      and is easily enjoyed with added milk, but can be enjoyed by itself if you like bold, 
intense coffee flavours.
    </pre>
    <hr>
    <pre class="pretag2">Which coffee type has the mildest taste?

        A latte is generally considered the least intense coffee. Made with freshly brewed espresso,
          the taste is then made less intense because of the volume of milk added, which makes
             it sweeter tasting and with a more mellow taste.
